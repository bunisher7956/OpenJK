JEDI KNIGHT: UNLIMITED

---------------------------------------------------------

Jedi Knight: Unlimited is an open source mod for the game
Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy.

Built with OpenJK as the base, the mod intends to heavily
revise the gameplay with a focus on being both competitve
and balanced. To complement this gameplay, we are also
implementing various toggleable features for communities
who wish to roleplay, ensuring that the mod can reasonably
cater to multiple playstyles.

In addition to this, the game's interface is being wholly
revamped to help improve the user experience and provide
a more moderised look.

Special thanks to the creators of OpenJK, of which this
mod is built upon, in addition to Open Jedi Project Team
for the animations used and as another source reference.

To run the game, execute the run_jku.bat script located
in the root game directory.
